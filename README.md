# ARKit 2 Image Tracking Demo
iOS 12 + ARKit 2 + Image tracking means: Harry Potter style moving pictures, living movie posters, video postcards, paper-thin “displays,” and lots more augmented reality fun.

This project is a quick & dirty repurposing of Apple's ARKit 1 project "Recognizing Images in an AR Experience" to test ARKit 2's image tracking capabilities.
